# SharePoint Online View It (spo_view_it)
Force SPO to Reading View

Available on [Chrome Web Store: SPO View It](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spo-view-it/omljlibfjloccmdmmlpcnlijjneabhjm)

Sometimes SharePoint Online defaults to opening a Word or Excel document in the *Editing View* instead of the preferred *Reading View*.

* this extension changes the URL so that the *Reading View* is opened
* this is done by changing the URL parameter: *action=default* to *action=view*
* you will still be able to then use: Edit Document -> Edit in Browser
